RedPipe is a collection of python scripts to aid with Optical Photometric and Spectroscopic Data Reduction. There are scripts on preprocessing, photometry, calibration, spectroscopy, analysis and plotting. The photometry and spectroscopy codes use pyraf and hence require an already existing installation of Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF).

The scripts are still under development.
